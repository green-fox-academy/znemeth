## **Project documentation**

We have been creating a program that is able to detect and modify shapes and text on images.<br/> <br/>
We use the following technologies:
* C++14
* MySQL
* OpenCV library
* Google Test<br/>

List of available functions, their definitions, and short descriptions:

- sort vector (counting sort)

 `std::vector<int> countingSort(std::vector<int> list, bool isAscending)`<br/>
The function takes a vector of integers as input and sort them according to the counting sort algorithm. If isAscending is true, the sort is going to be performed in ascending order. Otherwise, the sort is going to be performed in descending order.<br/>
