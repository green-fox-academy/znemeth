## **Project documentation**

We have been creating a program that is able to detect and modify shapes and text on images.<br/> <br/>
We use the following technologies:
* C++14
* MySQL
* OpenCV library
* Google Test<br/>

List of available features, their functions, and short descriptions:

- sort vector (shaker sort)

`std::vector<int> shakerSort(std::vector<int> list, bool isAscending)`<br/>
The function takes a vector of integers as input and sort them according to the shaker sort algorithm. If isAscending is true the return vector's going to be in ascending order if isAscending is false, it's going to be in descending order. <br/>
