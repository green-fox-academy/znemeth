## **Project documentation**

We have been creating a program that is able to detect and modify shapes and text on images.<br/> <br/>
We use the dollowing technologies:
* C++14
* MySQL
* OpenCV library
* Google Test<br/>

List of available features, their functions, and short descriptions:

- sort vector (bubble sort)

`std::vector<int> bubbleSort(std::vector<int> list, bool isAscending)`<br/>
The function takes a vector of integers as input and sort them according to the bubble sort algorithm. If isAscending is true the return vector is going to be in ascending order, if isAscending is false it is going to be in descending order. <br/>
