## **Project documentation**

We have been creating a program that is able to detect and modify shapes and text on images.<br/> <br/>
We use the following technologies:
* C++14
* MySQL
* OpenCV library
* Google Test<br/>

List of available features, their functions, and short descriptions:

- separate color
`cv::Mat separateColor(cv::Mat image);`<br/>
The color image as input is split according to its RGB channels. The output is an image that consist of 3 subimages representing only the R, G, and B channels of the original image.<br/>
